## Upcoming Bear-Shell Release: 1.4.3.
- Entirely reworked terminal
- Vim integration for dev, user, and root terminals
- Cleaner command handling

## What am I planning on doing?
Well, in July I'm mostly thinking about adding as many commands to my [Shell](https://github.com/BizzyPythonBear/Bear-Shell) as possible, since I want to be able to use it as the main hub for where I do everything. I essentially just want to make it a terminal but with more of a UI.

## About the Bear-Utils organization
The bear utils org's only purpose is to house all project's with "Bear-" before them, which those repos are now also all apart of Bear-Utils
