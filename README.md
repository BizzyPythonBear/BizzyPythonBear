## What am I planning on doing?
Well, in July I'm mostly thinking about adding as many commands to my [Shell](https://github.com/BizzyPythonBear/Bear-Shell) as possible, since I want to be able to use it as the main hub for where I do everything. I essentially just want to make it a terminal but with more of a UI.
