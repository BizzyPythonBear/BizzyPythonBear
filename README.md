# LARGE ANNOUNCEMENT!!
Bear-Shell-Unstable is going to become the new Bear-Shell, I feel it's too stressful to think about two things at once, trying to update both, and its just a mess. So, there will now be ONE repository from now on!

# ANOTHER LARGE ANNOUNCEMENT!!
For ease of use, and since windows does not need a shell, Bear-Shell will be ported over to be LINUX only!

## Upcoming Bear-Shell Release: 2.4.5.
- Entirely reworked terminal
- Vim integration for dev, user, and root terminals
- Cleaner command handling

## What am I planning on doing?
Well, in July I'm mostly thinking about adding as many commands to my [Shell](https://github.com/BizzyPythonBear/Bear-Shell) as possible, since I want to be able to use it as the main hub for where I do everything. I essentially just want to make it a terminal but with more of a UI.

## About the Bear-Utils organization
The bear utils org's only purpose is to house all project's with "Bear-" before them, which those repos are now also all apart of Bear-Utils
